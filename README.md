# query-time-evaluation
To evaluate query execution time in pgAdmin

The main is in time_collector.py, while the library with the functions we use in the utils.py

In the folder queries, there are the queries to execute, with no comments, each in a different txt file. 
In the queries directory there are all the queries to run on the database with the onstraints, 
while in the other sub direcotries there are the queries to run in other databases or that need an extra code,
the name of the directory is self-explanatory.
